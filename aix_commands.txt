AIX Commands
How can I change from one kernel mode to another?

During the installation process, one of the kernels, appropriate for the AIX version and the hardware in operation, is enabled by default. Use the method from the previous question and assume that the 32-bit kernel is enabled. Also assume that you want to boot it up in the 64-bit kernel mode. This can be done by running the following commands in sequence:

ln -sf /usr/lib/boot/unix_64     /unix
ln -sf /usr/lib/boot/unix_64     /usr/lib/boot/unix

    #bosboot -ad  /dev/hdiskxx
    #shutdown -r

The /dev/hdiskxx directory is where the boot logical volume /dev/hd5 is located. To find out what xx is in hdiskxx, run the following command:

    #   lslv -m hd5

 
 Run the prtconf command. If it is a CHRP machine, the string chrp appears on the Model Architecture line.

 To delete the accounting attribute from a file system, enter:
    #    chfs -d account /home
 This command removes the accounting attribute from the /home file system. The accounting attribute is deleted from the /home: stanza of the /etc/filesystems file.

 To split off a copy of a mirrored file system and mount it read-only for use as an online backup, enter:
    #   chfs -a splitcopy=/backup -a copy=2 /testfs
 This mounts a read-only copy of /testfs at /backup.

 To change the file system size of the /test JFS, enter:
    #   chfs -a size=64M /test

 This command mounts the snapshot contained on the /dev/snapsb device onto the /home/janet/snapsb directory.

 To mount a file system and create a snapshot, enter the following command:
    #   mount ‑o snapto=/dev/snapsb /dev/sb /home/janet/sb
 This command mounts the file system contained on the /dev/sbdevice directory onto the /home/janet/sb directory and creates a snapshot for the file system on /dev/snapsbdevice.

 To remount the mounted read-only JFS2 file system to a read-write file system, enter the following command:
    #   mount –o remount,rw fsname

 
 Note:

To reinstate firmware-assisted dump, type:
    #   sysdumpdev -t fw‑assisted
Note:
The firmware-assisted system dump will be configured at the next reboot.

To determine the amount of paging space allocated and in use:
    #   lsps -a

To increase a paging space:
You can use the chps -s command to dynamically increase the size of a paging space. For example, if you want to increase the size of hd6 with three logical partitions, you issue the following command:
    #   chps -s 3 hd6

To change the size of the myvg paging space, enter:
    #   chps  -s 4 myvg
This adds four logical partitions to the myvg paging space.

To reduce a paging space:
You can use the chps -d command to dynamically reduce the size of a paging space. For example, if you want to decrease the size of hd6 with four logical partitions, you issue the following command:
    #   chps -d 4 hd6

How would I know if my system is capable of using simultaneous multithreading (SMT)?

Your system is capable of SMT if it is an IBM POWER5 processor-based system or later running AIX 5L Version 5.3 or later.

To know if SMT is enabled for my system?
If you run the smtctl command without any options, it tells you if it is enabled or not.

SMT is supported for both 32-bit and 64-bit kernel.

Note:

AIX V5.3 32-bit kernel only supports SMT 2. For SMT 4 exploitation, you would need to run AIX V5.3 in a versioned workload partition (WPAR) on top of AIX V7.1 (described in the Workload partitions section). The 32-bit kernel was removed in AIX V6.1.

To enable or disable SMTr:
You can enable or disable SMT by running the smtctl command. The following is the syntax:
smtctl [ -m off | on [ -w boot | now]]

The following options are available:

Option  Description
-m off  Sets SMT mode to disabled
-m on   Sets SMT mode to enabled
-w boot Makes the SMT mode change effective on next and subsequent reboots if you run the bosboot command before the next system reboot
-w now  Makes the SMT mode change immediately but will not persist across reboot
If neither the -w boot option nor the -w now option is specified, then the mode change is made immediately. It persists across subsequent reboots if you run the bosboot command before the next system reboot.

To disable simultaneous multithreading for the current boot cycle and for all subsequent boots, enter:
smtctl -m off
The system displays a message similar to the following:
smtctl: SMT is now disabled. It will persist across reboots if you run the bosboot command before the next reboot.

To get partition-specific information and statistics:
The lparstatcommand provides a report of partition information and utilization statistics. This command also provides a display of hypervisor information.

To get the default LPAR statistics, enter the following command:
    #   lparstat 1 1


To get default LPAR statistics with summary statistics on Hypervisor, enter the following command:
    #   lparstat –h 1 1

To get the information about the partition, enter the following command:
    #   lparstat -i

To get detailed hypervisor statistics, enter the following command:
    #   lparstat –H 1 1

To get statistics about the shared memory pool and the I/O memory entitlement of the partition, enter the following command:
    #   lparstat –m
Note:
The m option is not available in AIX 5.3.

Volume groups and logical volumes

AIX V7.1 includes enhanced support for solid-state drive (SSD) in the AIX Logical Volume Manager (LVM). The commands lsvg, mkvg, chvg, extendvg, and replacepv described in the following sections support creation, extension, and maintenance of volume groups consisting of SSDs.

To know if volume group is normal, big, or scalable?
Run the lsvg command on the volume group and look at the value for MAX PVs. The value is 32 for normal, 128 for big, and 1024 for scalable volume group.

To create a volume group? Use the following command, where spartition_size sets the number of megabytes (MB) in each physical partition where the partition_size is expressed in units of MB from 1 through 1024. (It is 1 through 131072 for AIX V5.3.) The partition_size variable must be equal to a power of 2 (for example: 1, 2, 4, 8). The default value for standard and big volume groups is the lowest value to remain within the limitation of 1016 physical partitions per physical volume. The default value for scalable volume groups is the lowest value to accommodate 2040 physical partitions per physical volume.
    #   mkvg -y name_of_volume_group -s partition_size list_of_hard_disks

To create a volume group that contains three physical volumes with partition size set to 1 MB, type:
    #   mkvg  -s 1 hdisk3 hdisk5 hdisk6

The volume group is created with an automatically generated name, which is displayed and available at system restart time.

To create a volume group that can accommodate a maximum of 1024 physical volumes and 2048 logical volumes, type:
    #   mkvg -S -v 2048 hdisk6

To change the characteristics of a volume group:
    #   chvg

To cause volume group vg03 to be automatically activated during system startup, type:
    #   chvg  -a y vg03

In AIX 7.1, you can also use the System Management Interface Tool (SMIT) smit chvg fast path to run this command.

To create a logical volume?
    #   mklv -y name_of_logical_volume name_of_volume_group number_of_partition

To make a logical volume in vg03 with 15 logical partitions chosen from physical volumes hdisk5, hdisk6, and hdisk9, type:
    $   mklv vg03 15 hdisk5 hdisk6 hdisk9

To increase the size of a logical volume:
To increase the size of the logical volume represented by the lv05 directory by three logical partitions, for example, type:
    #   extendlv lv05 3

To display all logical volumes that are part of a volume group (for example, rootvg)?
You can display all logical volumes that are part of rootvg by typing the following command:
    #   lsvg -l rootvg

To display the names of all active volume groups, enter the following command:
    #   lsvg -o


To display the names of all volume groups within the system, enter the following command:

lsvg


To display information about volume group vg02, enter the following command:
    #   lsvg vg02
The characteristics and status of both the logical and physical partitions of volume group vg02 are displayed.

To list information about logical volumes:

To display information about the logical volume lv1:
    #   lslv lv1

To display the logical volume allocation map for hdisk2, enter:
    #   lslv ‑p hdisk2
An allocation map for hdisk2 is displayed, showing the state of each partition. Because no LogicalVolume` parameter was included, the map does not contain logical partition numbers specific to any logical volume.

To display information about the lv03 logical volume by physical volume, enter:
    #   lslv -l lv03
The characteristics and status of lv03 are displayed, with the output arranged by physical volume.

To remove a logical volume from a volume group: to remove the logical volume lv7 by running the following command:
    #   rmlv lv7
The rmlv command removes only the logical volume, but does not remove other entities, such as file systems or paging spaces that were using the logical volume.

To  mirror a logical volume:
    #   mklvcopy LogicalVolumeName Numberofcopies
    #   syncvg VolumeGroupName
The syncvg command synchronizes the logical volume copies.

To add physical partitions to the logical partitions in the lv01 logical volume, so that a total of three copies exist for each logical partition, enter:
    #   mklvcopy lv01 3
The logical partitions in the logical volume represented by the lv01 directory have three copies.

To remove a copy of a logical volume:

You can use the rmlvcopy command to remove copies of logical partitions of a logical volume. To reduce the number of copies of each logical partition belonging to the testlv logical volume, enter:
    #   rmlvcopy testlv 2
Each logical partition in the logical volume now has at most two physical partitions.

Queries about volume groups

To show volume groups in the system, type:
    #   lsvg

To show all the characteristics of rootvg, type:
    #   lsvg rootvg

To show disks used by rootvg, type:
    #   lsasvg -p rootvg


To add a disk to a volume group:
    #   extendvg   VolumeGroupName  hdisk0 hdisk1 ... hdiskn

To add physical volumes hdisk3 and hdisk8 to volume group vg3, enter:
    #   extendvg vg3 hdisk3 hdisk8


Note:

The volume group must be varied on before extending.

To find out the maximum supported logical track group (LTG) size of my hard disk:
You can use the lquerypv command with the -M flag. The output gives the LTG size in KB. For instance, the LTG size for hdisk0 in the following example is 256 KB.
    #   /usr/sbin/lquerypv ‑M hdisk0
        256


You can also run the lspv command on the hard disk and look at the value for MAX REQUEST.

syncvg command:

The syncvg command is used to synchronize stale physical partitions. It accepts names of logical volumes, physical volumes, or volume groups as parameters.

To synchronize the physical partitions located on physical volumes hdisk4 and hdisk5, use:
    #   syncvg -p hdisk4 hdisk5

To synchronize all physical partitions from volume group testvg, use:
    #   syncvg -v testvg

To synchronize the copies on volume groups vg04 and vg05, enter:
    #   syncvg -v vg04 vg05


How do I replace a disk?

extendvg VolumeGroupName hdisk_new
migratepv hdisk_bad hdisk_new
reducevg -d VolumeGroupName hdisk_bad
The command migratepv moves allocated physical partitions from one physical volume to one or more other physical volumes.

The reducevg command removes physical volumes from a volume group. When all the physical volumes are removed from the volume group, the volume group is deleted.

To  clone (make a copy of) the rootvg:
You can run the alt_disk_copy command to copy the current rootvg to an alternate disk. The following example shows how to clone the rootvg to hdisk1.
    #   alt_disk_copy ‑d  hdisk1


Network:
How can I display or set values for network parameters?

The no command sets or displays current or next boot values for network tuning parameters.
